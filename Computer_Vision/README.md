# Computer Vision
This section presents the way the computer vision pipeline works and how the training for the custom models was done.

## Training
The repository is not a tutorial on how to train a custom yolov4 model, but the way we did it is presented here. 
As of now, yolov4 is not available on either Pytorch nor Tensorflow, therefore we had to use the Darknet framework. 

### 1- Darknet installation

### 2- Data collection 

### 3- Labeling

### 4- Training

### 5- Transfering from Darknet weights to .tflite model

## Inference pipeline
