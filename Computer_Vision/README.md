#Computer Vision
This section will present the way the computer vision pipelin works and how the training for the costum models has been done.

## training
The repository is not a tutorial on how to train a custom yolov4 model, but the way we did it is presented here. 
As of now, yolov4 is not available on either Pytorch nor Tensorflow, therefore we had no other choice but to use the not so friendly darknet framework. 

#### 1- Darknet installation

#### 2- Data collection 

#### 3- Labeling

#### 4- Training


#### 5- Transfering from Darknet weights to .tflite model
